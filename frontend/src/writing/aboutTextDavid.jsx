const aboutTextDavid =`David Froman is 29, having gotten a BS degree in physics, and another in mathematics. Having decided he didn't like any of the jobs available for that education level, he realized that while he loved those fields, what he was being taught in his continuing education wasn't what he wanted to learn. So he took a few years off, worked to earn enough money to go back to school for something new, and is now a student at PSU studying CS and is two terms away from graduating.`
