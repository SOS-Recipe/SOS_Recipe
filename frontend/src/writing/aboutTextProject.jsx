const aboutTextProject =`SOS Recipe started as an idea to be able to put what's in your fridge into a list, query some database, and get a list of all the recipies that could be made with those ingredients. That shining goal didn't last long. It eventually morphed into what we see today, an app that queries a database for one search and returns all results. We feel we did some cool things and made a pretty nice little app, and we hope you like it as much as we do. `
